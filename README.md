# Elastic Gyro Text Animation

This is a simple p5.js project demonstrating:

- A "typewriter" text reveal animation.
- Elastic vertical oscillation of each character in response to device gyroscope tilt.
- Text block centered within the viewport with responsive margins.

## Files

- `index.html`: Entry point to load p5.js and `sketch.js`.
- `sketch.js`: Main p5.js sketch containing the animation logic.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. On desktop, the device gyroscope is requested but may not be available.
3. On mobile, grant gyroscope permission. Tilt your device to see the elastic motion.

## Deployment

Simply host these files (e.g., on GitHub Pages or any static server) and navigate to the page.
